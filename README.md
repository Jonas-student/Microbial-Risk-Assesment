# Microbial Risk Assessment

This repository contains all the materials and code for the two assignments focused on **Microbial Risk Assessment (MRA)**. 
The assignment aims to model and quantify the risks posed by microbial hazards to human health, using statistical techniques.

## Structure

- Project 1: Signorini et al. (2013) published a quantitative risk assessment of human campylobacteriosis
by consumption of salad, from cross-contamination with Campylobacter spp. from broiler meat in
Argentina. They first describe the exposure assessment, which contains the prevalence estimation
of Campylobacter spp. in poultry carcasses in slaughterhouses and in retail. Second, in the dose-
response assessment, probability of infection and probability of illness are described. In the risk
characterization, information is combined to study the probability of occurrence and severity of
adverse health effects due to exposure with Campylobacter spp. from eating salad.

  Under the file **Project1.R**, the according code for the first assignment is included.
